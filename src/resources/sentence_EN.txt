In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.
There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.
Each man lived his own life, and paid his own price for living it.
Never give up on what makes you smile.
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
Being against evil doesn't make you good.
Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.
The price of greatness is responsibility.
To succeed in life, you need two things ignorance and confidence.
When in doubt, tell the truth.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
Once you stop learning, you start dying.
